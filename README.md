The modular wearable robotic suit would help patients and users to walk, initially in controlled environments and gradually in a daily assistive device manner. This would not only boost their independence and self-reliance, but it would also help to bring equal opportunities to them and allow them to participate in socio-economic activities. This is something the community struggles with now.<br>The device would also come with a patient monitoring system with a data visualization and analysis platform.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | [https://www.astrekinnovations.com](https://www.astrekinnovations.com)           | Health Tech                                                                        | Robotics                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | Artificial Intelligence,Robotics,Machine Learning                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | Kochi                                                | 200000                                                    | Angel Round                        | Startup Chile Grant 40 K USD 2018<br>KSUM Grant 7 Lakhs<br>MEITY GRANT 20 Lakhs<br>Nidhi Prayas Grant 10 Lakhs<br>Angel Round .75 Lakhs .

In many cases, industries require reliable and robust simulations which makes them complex and thereby increases their turnaround times. Hence, this creates the problem for many companies as it would increase time to market for their product. Since time to market is a priority, companies try to use low accuracy simulations which can be performed relatively quickly but aren’t always reliable and causes engineering failures.<br><br>BosonQ Psi is working to develop a next generation simulation software that provides faster turnaround times by utilizing Quantum computing. In doing so, our software promises to reduce time to market for products while producing high accuracy results. This will, in one hand, save cost for our customers by reducing computational effort and avoiding engineering failures, and on other hand, help generate revenue by reduced time to market.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | [https://www.bosonqpsi.com/](https://www.bosonqpsi.com/)                         | Manufacturing Tech                                                                 | Quantum Computing                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | Bhilai                                               | Pre-launch: No revenue                                    | 0                                  | Angel Round                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | 525000                    | Abhishek Chopra                | [https://www.linkedin.com/in/ac1552/](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ac1552/)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

Through the use of multi-sensor systems and machine learning, we bring clarity, efficiency, and scale to wastewater management practices, globally. In India, our wastewater monitoring system, FluidWMS, has been deployed for monitoring wastewater infrastructure contributing to over 700 MLD (Million Liters a Day) of raw sewage entering urban lakes and rivers across India, all while eliminating risk to human life. This data-driven approach has allowed cities, for the first time, to sustainably intercept and divert this untreated wastewater to treatment plants, significantly reducing water pollution. Our solution maps and monitors the health of old and deteriorating pipeline networks, carrying water, sewage, and stormwater, allowing cities to rehabilitate critical infrastructure before catastrophic damages. Our automated pipeline fault detection software, FluidAI, optimizes the manual process of pipeline condition assessment. We have on-going deployments with water companies in the US to help speed up pipeline inspections, allowing customers to ensure environmental compliance.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | [www.fluidrobotics.com](http://www.fluidrobotics.com)                            | Water/ Wastewater/ Sanitation                                                      | Robotics/ AI                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | Robotics/ AI                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | Pune                                                 | Seed                                                      | Undisclosed                        | NA                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | NA                        | Asim Bhalerao                  | [https://www.linkedin.com/in/asimbhalerao/](https://www.linkedin.com/in/asimbhalerao/)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

The increasing incidence of CVDs leads to a surge in demand for diagnostic imaging devices for precise diagnosis and improved patient outcomes. Diagnostic image interpretation needs trained Physicians Specialists (Radiologists. Cardiologists, etc.). There is an estimated shortage in Physician Specialists of up to 139,000, including 42,000 radiologists (by 2033) in USA alone - where access to both diagnostic imaging technology and physicians is considered as among the best worldwide.

In our software we have designed a human security analyst’s brain which scans your system. This brain resides locally on each computer which is equivalent to having your own army of cyber security specialists protecting each computer. When a virus is caught, it kills all connections to hacker’s server & cleans everything without any manual intervention. All reports can be seen & managed centrally on cloud. Here our AI brain explains in simple English, what a caught virus was doing & why it was flagged as a virus, so it becomes very easy for your IT team to take a decision to delete it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | [www.matisoftlabs.com](http://www.matisoftlabs.com)                              | Horizontal                                                                         | Cyber Security                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | AI                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | New Delhi                                            | Unknown                                                   | NA                                 | NA                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | NA                        | Varun Seth                     | [https://www.linkedin.com/in/varunseth111/](https://www.linkedin.com/in/varunseth111/)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

All the user has to do is choose a recipe, load the Ingredients and press cook. From thereon, Julia adds ingredients in the correct amount, stirs, regulates temperature and ensures the dish is cooked perfectly through thermal and visual feedback. Julia gives users the freedom to use their own fresh ingredients and allows them to tweak the recipe according their own taste.; ; It is much smarter thanks to an array of sensors that help Julia measure change in colour, texture, weight, etc. in real time to ensure food is cooked perfectly.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | [www.nymble.in](http://www.nymble.in)                                            | Retail consumers                                                                   |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | Artificial Intelligence, Deep Learning, IoT                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | Bangalore                                            |                                                           |                                    | Nymble was part of the first batch of the Bosch DNA Accelerator and has been supported by grants from the Government of Karnataka. ; ; In March 2019, the startup raised an undisclosed amount of funding from early-stage venture capital firm WaterBridge Ventures, Flipkart co-founder Binny Bansal ,VC firm 021 Capital, angel investor Asha Jadeja Motwani amongst others.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |                           | Rohin                          |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

The user clicks a picture of his/her national ID card (our ML algorithms detect fake/ tampered ID cards, blur photos and photocopies of ID cards). ; 2) Text and Photo from ID card is extracted and auto-filled. ; 3) Through the front camera of user's phone/laptop the photo on ID card is matched with the user's face in real time (liveliness detection and facial recognition).; ; The user is on boarded in less than 60 seconds.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | [www.invoid.co](http://www.invoid.co)                                            | Horizontal                                                                         | Identity Verification Solutions                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | AI, Computer Vision                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | New Delhi                                            | Seed                                                      | NA                                 | NA                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | NA                        | Kunwar Raj Singh               | [https://www.linkedin.com/in/kunwarraj01/](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kunwarraj01/)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

Meetings are but a means to an end and the productivity tools such as transcription and notes generation would not sufficiently address the most important question of all, is this meeting really needed? SaanScript brings a new depth to traditional transcripts with insights and predictable outcomes for every task.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | [www.saanketh.com](http://www.saanketh.com)                                      | Horizontal                                                                         | Voice Communications                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | NLP and AI analytics                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | Hyderabad, India                                     | Bootstrapped                                              | 1,50,000                           | 1,50,000                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | 25-04-2021                | Anil K Neela                   | [https://www.linkedin.com/in/anil-neela/](https://www.linkedin.com/in/anil-neela/)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

The technological advantage is the hybrid technology with smart software algorithm engines/hardware for both manned and unmanned operations can be configured to suit the particular vehicle irrespective of its size, type, propulsion and application. It uses self- tuning artificial intelligence algorithms which learns the vehicle responses and adapts itself to it. It can be used as a simple autopilot to a high-end standalone unmanned system. The technology can be installed/ retrofitted on any kind of new and existing boat/ vessel.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | [http://sagardefence.com/](http://sagardefence.com/)                             | Robotics                                                                           | Industry 4.0                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | Genesis"Boat in a Box"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Pune                                                 | Pre-series A                                              | 1735500                            | 1130090                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | 44324                     | Nikunj Parashar                | [https://www.linkedin.com/in/nikunj-parashar-7b249a23/](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nikunj-parashar-7b249a23/)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

Phrazor can also create personalized reports, at scale, in seconds.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | [https://phrazor.ai/](https://phrazor.ai/)                                       | Horizontal                                                                         | Across all function: Marketing, Sales, Finance, Human Resources, Supply Chain, Operations,Strategy, and Digital Transformation                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | Artificial Intelligence, Automation / RPA, Deep Learning, Machine Learning, Natural Language Generation, Natural Language Processing                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | Mumbai                                               | Series A                                                  | 2.25 million US Dollars            | 2 million US Dollars: Falcon Edge Capital - USD 1 MN and Bharat Innovation Funds - USD 1 MN                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | 43685                     | Neerav Parekh                  | [https://www.linkedin.com/in/neeravparekh](https://www.linkedin.com/in/neeravparekh)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
